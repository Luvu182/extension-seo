## Implementation Details

The SEO score is calculated by:

2. Converting raw scores to percentage scores for each category
3. Calculating the weighted average based on the category weights:
   - Content Elements: 45%
   - Technical SEO: 40%
   - Structure & Linking: 15%

## UI Changes

The updated UI displays:
- Category scores with both raw points and percentage scores
- The weight of each category in the overall score
- A circular indicator showing the overall score with color coding
- Additional explanatory text about the scoring system

## Notes for Future Improvements

1. **Keyword Analysis**: Consider adding more sophisticated keyword analysis that can detect target keywords and their distribution throughout key page elements
2. **Heading Structure Analysis**: Improve the analysis of heading structure hierarchy to detect improper nesting
3. **Performance Metrics**: Integrate more detailed performance metrics from Core Web Vitals for a more accurate performance score
4. **Mobile-Friendly Testing**: Add more comprehensive mobile-friendly tests beyond just viewport meta tag checking
5. **Schema Validation**: Add validation of schema markup to ensure it's properly formatted and contains required properties
